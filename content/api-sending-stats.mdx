## Sending stats

## `POST /api/collect`

To register a `pageview` or `event`, you need to send a `POST` to `/api/collect` with
the following data:

```
{
    payload: {
        website: "your-website-id",
        url: "/",
        referrer: "",
        hostname: "your-hostname",
        language: "en-US",
        screen: "1920x1080",
    },
    type: "pageview"
}
```

For events, from v1.37 onwards, you would send:

```
{
    payload: {
        website: "your-website-id",
        url: "/",
        event_name: "click-signup-button",
        hostname: "your-hostname",
        language: "en-US",
        screen: "1920x1080"
    },
    type: "event"
}
```

Prior to v1.37, the `event_name` was separated into two different fields: `event_type` and `event_value`:

```
{
    payload: {
        website: "your-website-id",
        url: "/",
        event_type: "click",
        event_value: "signup-button",
        hostname: "your-hostname",
        language: "en-US",
        screen: "1920x1080"
    },
    type: "event"
}
```

Note, for `/api/collect` requests you do not need to send an
authentication token.

Also, you need to send a proper `User-Agent` HTTP header or
your request won't be registered.
