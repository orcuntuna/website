## Authentication

## `POST /api/auth/login`

First you need to get a _token_ in order to make API requests. You need to make a
`POST` request to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint with the following data:

```json
{
  "username": "your-username",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

If successful you should get a response like the following:

```json
{
  "token": "eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A"
}
```

Save the token value and send an `Authorization` header with all your data requests with the value `Bearer <token>`. Your request header should look something like this:

```http request
Authorization: Bearer eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A
```

For example, with `curl` it would look like this:

```shell
curl https://yoursever/api/websites
   -H "Accept: application/json"
   -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

Prior to v1.26.0, Umami used cookies. If using an older version, you would do the following instead:

Save the token value and pass it as a _cookie_ with all your data requests.
The cookie name is `umami.auth`. Your request header should look something like this:

```
Cookie: umami.auth=eyTMjU2IiwiY...4Q0JDLUhWxnIjoiUE_A
```
